FYI:all drills can be accomplished with no mouse at all

you can use any shortcuts u know, the ones here can be helpfull in the upcoming drills, use anything you want and be creative.
P.S:the shortcuts im suggesting for specific drills should be used in all the drills if you think its necessary(if not specifically stated otherwise)
general instructions:
from now on try not to touch mouse at all(can be accomplished), move through tabs with alt + tab and move thorugh VS code and browser tabs with ctrl+tab

good shortcuts for drill 1 and 2  :
windows+arrows = adjust the current screen size
windows+d = desktop
ctr+alt+t = create new terminal
alt+F4 or ctr +q = close window
alt+tab\shift+tab = move thrugh windows
ctr+a = choose all
ctr+tab= move through tabs
ctr+shift+tab= move backwards through windows
ctr+t = new tab
ctr+w = close tab
ctr+n = open new browser(if already inside browser)



drill 1:browser movement
(you have 1 mouse use allowed)
1.open google chrome(with mouse)
2.go to search bar and type in linux (alt + d)
3.go into the wikipedia page of linux (tab and afterward enter)
4.open 2 new empty tabs (ctrl + t)
5.navigate backwards to the first empty tab (ctrl + shift + tab) and close it ( ctrl + w)
6.go back to the second empty tab and close that also (ctrl + w)
7.go to the desktop and then open a new terminal ( ctrl + alt + t) and then in the same termianl open another tab(ctrl + shift + t) and go back to tab 1 (alt + 1)
8.in the wikipedia page of linux copy all the page content(ctrl + a)
9.go back to the terminal and make it fit the whole screen (super + up arrow)
10.paste content of linux wiki page to terminal ( ctrl + shift + v)
11.go to the top of the terminal page and backward (shift + pageup and shift + pagedown)
12.close everything(alt + F4 )

drill 2:screen movement
1.open google chrome(with mouse)
2.open another chrome in incognito mode (ctrl + shift + n)
and make each of them take up half of the screen(super + arrows)

tips:
ctrl + / = comment/uncomment line
shift + arrow = mark character
ctrl + arrows = jump to next word
ctrl + arrows + shift = mark words and jump 
end = go to end of line
shift + end = mark to the end of line


drill 3:visual code
in this drill you CANT:
* just press repeatedly the arrow button to go through the code, you have to use the shortcuts.
* no mouse is allowed whatsoever
* cant delete commented lines with backspace
in App.js:
1.uncomment the commented lines(ctrl + /)
2.go to line 11
3.go to the words Slim Shady(without pressing arrows repedetly) and mark it *(ctrl + shift + arrows)*
4.use *(ctrl + d)* to mark all the other occurrence(of the word Slim Shady) in the song and replace them with elad Reuveni
5.in the start of line 11 create multiple cursor down to line 17 and allign them with row 10
6.give all the p tags the class m&m(all together, not one by one )
7.you have 4 p tags and 8 lines of song, move each 2 lines of the song to a separate p tag *(go to start of upper line and use shift+arrow)*, then move lines with *(alt+arrows)*


tips:
ctrl + shift + e = go to explorer(visual code)
shift + F10 = simulate right click
F2(while standing on a file) = edit the file name

bonus drill 4(harder):visual code
go to VScode explorer
navigae to app.js and right click it(no mouse , shift + F10)
choose copy and then paste it(arrows)
navigate to App copy.js and rename it to myApp.js(F2)
right click myApp.js(no mouse , shift + F10) and delete it

if you finished just try and do what you do usually , just with out mouse :)
