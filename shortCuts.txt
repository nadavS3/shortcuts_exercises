pro
(VC)ctr+shift+e = go to explorer *** if not working: This is because ctrl + shift + E is assigned to emoji input. TO disable that go to terminal & type $ ibus-setup window will open third tab will be emojis tab. change the shortcut key ctrl + shift + e to anything you like. then explorer shortcut key will perfectly work.***
